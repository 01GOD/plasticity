// For the purpose of keybindings, it's important to understand that plasticity can be in three states:
// 1. When no command is running
// 2. When a command, like fillet is running
// 3. When a command is running and you're actively using the gizmo (like dragging a handle)

// Probably the keybindings you want to change the most are case 1., when no command or gizmo is running.
