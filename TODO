Current:
. remove "beginning" snaps

Release:
. Intersection of curves snap points
. Intersection of newly activated axis (on hover) snaps

Video todo:
. Tangent axis activated at endpoint hover
. Perpendicular snap, Perp-perp snap
. Turn on off individual snap kinds
. xray snaps
. snapping projected to restrictions (either construction plane or axis)
. shift to lock snaps

Todo:
ctrl while point picking not working - https://discord.com/channels/893157887847845908/893157887847845913/896493308992421909
some gizmos should abort on interrupt (move xyz) and others should confirm (extrude)
camera near plane sucks with ortho now
crash https://discord.com/channels/893157887847845908/894216409188565012/896502833057243196
shift drag on offset face is thin solid

circle on corner box top or side face
better mirror influenced by moi
scale snap point on diagonal
viewport state saved

prolong on and off keybinding
don't display fillet curve button at non-joint endpoint
1 and 2 for distance 1 and 2
slow gizmo
more robust mirror
submenu icons
when move gizmo moves, it needs to reorient the circle towards camera

line2 raycasting bad ortho camera

restrict to plane rotation is annoying

make trim viewport selector more permissive

in moi if you run the same command twice it doesn't cancel the current one
currently FINISH is always available, even at step 1 of 3 points box.

- this disables subsequent cancel for example
- registry.add(command:finish) should maybe not happen in command executor but in await this.finished
- if so, each command needs to be slightly rewritten

stress test undo & redo

add dialogs for everything

some bugs with move screenspace sometimes, it flickers?

- try switching commands while doing 3 point box
  should project onto construction plane in ortho view
  min and max in number srubber should be respected

performance audit hit testing and snaps
refactor factory to take editorlike?

-         factory.curves = this.editor.curves; // FIXME need to DI this in constructor of all factories

change selection mode 123 keys
fix box select

drag drop points?

memoize mesh generation of faces in mesh creator (for the duration of a command).
memoize and discretize calculations like fillet

toggle kinds of snaps with keybindings?

need to convert offset curve to curve on surface

in moi, once you create a cylinder, you can shift once you lock onto Z axis; however, you can't then snap to match height. what do we want to do?

- shift should turn current axis snap into constraint?

drag and drop points

fillet face
extrude face
right click repeat

# c++ changes:

rename Id() .id

audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:
::AddRefItems( curveArray );
::ReleaseItems( curveArray );
and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD
Get planar curve and placement if the space curve is planar (after the using call **\*\*\***DeleteItem for two-dimensional curves).
