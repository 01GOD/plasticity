THIS WEEK:

transaction history

- autogenerate creator html element
- make more pretty
- delete creator
- 
- handle rebuild errors


BUG:

both point picker and abstract gizmo take callbacks that should be async, because they call update which is potentially async
cylinder not working in many cases

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- lots of push pull grow/shrink crashes
- figure 8 intersection hangs


FUTURE:

dialog box for settings
modifiers

test case for contour curve failing to extrude;
fillet curve thingy

right click repeat

draft solid

box selection

put freeze on visual models

bug: outlines broken by grid

audit all doCommit to ensure visibility is set to true on failure;
  - perhaps the catch on Editor should call cancel

visualize construction history of objects

go through all factories and see if you can return more specific types from doCommit, like:
    -  Promise<visual.SpaceInstance<visual.Curve3D>> 

audit VisualModel to see if we can simplify the recursive raycasting. It was originally introduced for LODs, but maybe it can be done with deep raycasting and hit filtering.

rethink the deep cloning.
  - perhaps objects that store references to visual.* can just use simple names instead and lookup from db on command 
  - maybe objects can be immutable; materials and highlighting can be a pre-render step
  - note also that the snaps associated with edges & curves & items generally are not obviously cloned
