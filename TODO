# PRE ALPHA:

stress test undo
integration tests for basic commands
orbiting while point picking is weird

# move keybindings outside of loop keybindings
- onPointerDown and on command (registry.addOne), store the viewport the pointer is over
- keep lastPointerEvent as a global on editor
- dispatch keyboard events to the target of lastPointerEvent
- ensure that regardless of what has focus (E.g,. after hitting the toolbar, keybindings are still processed)

curves:
    creating curves not on XY constr plane causes weirdness with the planecontourman
    curve movement not working well
    bridge curve
    drag drop points?
    duplicate edges to curves
    draw curve around solid
    multiline (stroke)
    file save and reload needs to respect curve segments:
    control point hover/unhover broken
    select after create
    fillet every corner


- interleaving with updating/commit on factory. use q?
  - also what happens if a command is cancelled but a long running job returns?

- when you delete region you delete its curve / and vice versa

- bug: clicking adds items to history even when no selection is changed

- region has equal sort priority to face, but higher when identical distance

- audit name generation in sample models to see how they obtained unique names

windows build

optimize outline code

add dialogs for everything

## POST ALPHA

performance audit hit testing and snaps
refactor factory to take editorlike?
  -         factory.curves = this.editor.curves; // FIXME need to DI this in constructor of all factories

change selection mode 123 keys
fix box select

- audit depth pass


memoize mesh generation of faces in mesh creator (for the duration of a command).
memoize and discretize calculations like fillet

toggle kinds of snaps with keybindings?

need to convert offset curve to curve on surface
extrude to target

in moi, once you create a cylinder, you can shift once you lock onto Z axis; however, you can't then snap to match height. what do we want to do?
  - shift should turn current axis snap into constraint?

masking? like in zbrush; imagine a box atop a cylinder. I want to mask the box so I can clip curve just that.

select edge and face add rotate face gizmo

moving needs to have snapping
drag and drop points    

fillet face
extrude face
https://github.com/bzztbomb
right click repeat

BUG/CRASH:
# 1
1. add regular polygon
2. extrude
3. fillet variable top face
4. push/pull face down
# 2
1. Add cylinder
2. Fillet top
3. Squeeze side to smallest possible
# 3
1. crashes-at-fillet-100.c3d
2. Fillet search 

# c++ changes:
rename Id() .id

audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:
    ::AddRefItems( curveArray );
    ::ReleaseItems( curveArray );
    and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether
    - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD
Get planar curve and placement if the space curve is planar (after the using call *******DeleteItem for two-dimensional curves).
convert everything to isPOD possible
  - ensure invocations to pass by reference use reference... but i think it should be fine.

- 3d Joints

gizmos for primitives

tab to re-enter last command of object

BUG:

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- lots of push pull grow/shrink crashes
- figure 8 intersection hangs

Viewport week:
- keybindings to create/remove viewports

Cleanup week:
- add dispose methods anywhere there is signal.add or .addEventListener
- audit geometry disposable
