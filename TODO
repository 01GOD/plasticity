interface to list modifiers with toggles for enable/disable and button to apply
mouseover not working for creators
selected face on a modifier is not highlighted
multiple modifiers don't work

# PRE ALPHA:

keybindings to move camera need to update construction plane
reinvoking commands should commit sometimes... i'm finding moving, click, then starting a new command leads to data loss

when you delete region you delete its curve / and vice versa

bug: clicking adds items to history even when no selection is changed

region has equal sort priority to face, but higher when identical distance

'# move keybindings outside of loop keybindings
- onPointerDown and on command (registry.addOne), store the viewport the pointer is over
- keep lastPointerEvent as a global on editor
- dispatch keyboard events to the target of lastPointerEvent
- ensure that regardless of what has focus (E.g,. after hitting the toolbar, keybindings are still processed)


curves:
    curve movement not working well
    bridge curve
    drag drop points?
    duplicate edges to curves
    draw curve around solid
    multiline (stroke)
    file save and reload needs to respect curve segments:
    control point hover/unhover broken


interleaving with updating/commit on factory. use q?
  - also what happens if a command is cancelled but a long running job returns?
refactor factory to take editorlike?
  -         factory.curves = this.editor.curves; // FIXME need to DI this in constructor of all factories
refactor selection.selected/hovered to be up in editor, avoid so much chaining

change selection mode 123 keys
fix box select

# transaction history
- delete creator
- select topo items
- mute creator, etc.
- handle rebuild errors
- there is a bug where fillet seems to highlight everything

performance audit hit testing and snaps

- audit depth pass

## POST ALPHA

toggle kinds of snaps with keybindings?

need to convert offset curve to curve on surface
extrude to target

in moi, once you create a cylinder, you can shift once you lock onto Z axis; however, you can't then snap to match height. what do we want to do?
  - shift should turn current axis snap into constraint?


masking? like in zbrush; imagine a box atop a cylinder. I want to mask the box so I can clip curve just that.

select edge and face add rotate face gizmo

moving needs to have snapping
drag and drop points    

fillet face
extrude face

right click repeat

BUG/CRASH:
# 1
1. add regular polygon
2. extrude
3. fillet variable top face
4. push/pull face down
# 2
1. Add cylinder
2. Fillet top
3. Squeeze side to smallest possible
# 3
1. crashes-at-fillet-100.c3d
2. Fillet search 

# c++ changes:
rename Id() .id

audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:
    ::AddRefItems( curveArray );
    ::ReleaseItems( curveArray );
    and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether
    - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD
Get planar curve and placement if the space curve is planar (after the using call *******DeleteItem for two-dimensional curves).
convert everything to isPOD possible
  - ensure invocations to pass by reference use reference... but i think it should be fine.

- 3d Joints

gizmos for primitives

tab to re-enter last command of object

BUG:

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- lots of push pull grow/shrink crashes
- figure 8 intersection hangs

Viewport week:
- keybindings to create/remove viewports

Cleanup week:
- add dispose methods anywhere there is signal.add or .addEventListener
- audit geometry disposable
