# PRE ALPHA:

keybindings to move camera

## COMMANDS
curve preview is broken
when you delete region you delete its curve / and vice versa
distance angle keybindgs broken for offset

# UNDO
bug: clicking adds items to history even when no selection is changed

## GIZMOS
reinvoking commands should commit sometimes... i'm finding moving, click, then starting a new command leads to data loss

## POST ALPHA
toggle kinds of snaps with keybindings?
region has equal sort priority to face, but higher when identical distance

curves:
    curve movement not working well
    bridge curve
    drag drop points?
    duplicate edges to curves
    draw curve around solid
    multiline (stroke)

need to convert offset curve to curve on surface
extrude to target

'# move keybindings outside of loop keybindings
- onPointerDown and on command (registry.addOne), store the viewport the pointer is over
- keep lastPointerEvent as a global on editor
- dispatch keyboard events to the target of lastPointerEvent
- ensure that regardless of what has focus (E.g,. after hitting the toolbar, keybindings are still processed)


in moi, once you create a cylinder, you can shift once you lock onto Z axis; however, you can't then snap to match height. what do we want to do?
  - shift should turn current axis snap into constraint?

delete Transactions.ts;

masking? like in zbrush; imagine a box atop a cylinder. I want to mask the box so I can clip curve just that.

interleaving with updating/commit on factory. use q?
  - also what happens if a command is cancelled but a long running job returns?
refactor factory to take editorlike?
  -         factory.curves = this.editor.curves; // FIXME need to DI this in constructor of all factories
refactor selection.selected/hovered to be up in editor, avoid so much chaining

select edge and face add rotate face gizmo

moving needs to have snapping
redo fillet gizmos
drag and drop points    

move selected/hovered up to editor;

fillet face
extrude face
https://github.com/bzztbomb
right click repeat

change selection mode 123 keys

non-linear history

BUG/CRASH:
# 1
1. add regular polygon
2. extrude
3. fillet variable top face
4. push/pull face down
# 2
1. Add cylinder
2. Fillet top
3. Squeeze side to smallest possible

# transaction history
- delete creator
- select topo items
- mute creator, etc.
- handle rebuild errors
- there is a bug where fillet seems to highlight everything

# c++ changes:
rename Id() .id

audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:
    ::AddRefItems( curveArray );
    ::ReleaseItems( curveArray );
    and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether
    - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD
Get planar curve and placement if the space curve is planar (after the using call *******DeleteItem for two-dimensional curves).
convert everything to isPOD possible
  - ensure invocations to pass by reference use reference... but i think it should be fine.

- 3d Joints


gizmos for primitives

tab to re-enter last command of object

auto save last object, auto lastGood

BUG:

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- lots of push pull grow/shrink crashes
- figure 8 intersection hangs


FUTURE:

dialog box for settings

bug: outlines broken by grid

--

Viewport week:
- keybindings to create/remove viewports
- change view with keybinding

Cleanup week:
- add dispose methods anywhere there is signal.add or .addEventListener
- audit geometry disposable

Snap week:
- Prettier snap display
- More snaps
- alt/whatever to disable snaps
