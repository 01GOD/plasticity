THIS WEEK:

ok cancel not working
cancel does nothing
left click cancels fillet

keyboard commands not working for move face? - it turns out that since viewports don't always have focus, the way we have of matching commands is wrong; need to attach to body i guess

transaction history


- delete creator
- mute creator, etc.
- handle rebuild errors


BUG:

it seems clear that scheduling stuff isn't entirely working; things can backlog somehow

both point picker and abstract gizmo take callbacks that should be async, because they call update which is potentially async
cylinder not working in many cases

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- lots of push pull grow/shrink crashes
- figure 8 intersection hangs


FUTURE:

dialog box for settings
modifiers

test case for contour curve failing to extrude;
fillet curve thingy

right click repeat

box selection

bug: outlines broken by grid

audit all doCommit to ensure visibility is set to true on failure;
  - perhaps the catch on Editor should call cancel

go through all factories and see if you can return more specific types from doCommit, like:
    -  Promise<visual.SpaceInstance<visual.Curve3D>> 

audit VisualModel to see if we can simplify the recursive raycasting. It was originally introduced for LODs, but maybe it can be done with deep raycasting and hit filtering.
