# PRE ALPHA:

file save and reload needs to respect curve segments:
curve fragment layer not set by highlighter

moving point deselecting not working

stress test undo & redo
offset face broken

curves:
    creating curves not on XY constr plane causes weirdness with the planecontourman
    curve movement not working well
    bridge curve
    duplicate edges to curves
    multiline (stroke)
    select after create
    fillet every corner


- when you delete region you delete its curve / and vice versa
- region has equal sort priority to face, but higher when identical distance

add dialogs for everything

windows build

min and max in number srubber should be respected
point picker nearby targets aren't scaling like normal helpers

## POST ALPHA

performance audit hit testing and snaps
refactor factory to take editorlike?
  -         factory.curves = this.editor.curves; // FIXME need to DI this in constructor of all factories

change selection mode 123 keys
fix box select

- audit depth pass

drag drop points?
    draw curve around solid


memoize mesh generation of faces in mesh creator (for the duration of a command).
memoize and discretize calculations like fillet

toggle kinds of snaps with keybindings?

need to convert offset curve to curve on surface
extrude to target

in moi, once you create a cylinder, you can shift once you lock onto Z axis; however, you can't then snap to match height. what do we want to do?
  - shift should turn current axis snap into constraint?

masking? like in zbrush; imagine a box atop a cylinder. I want to mask the box so I can clip curve just that.

select edge and face add rotate face gizmo

moving needs to have snapping
drag and drop points    

fillet face
extrude face

BUG/CRASH:
# 3
1. crashes-at-fillet-100.c3d
2. Fillet search 

# c++ changes:
rename Id() .id

audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:
    ::AddRefItems( curveArray );
    ::ReleaseItems( curveArray );
    and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether
    - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD
Get planar curve and placement if the space curve is planar (after the using call *******DeleteItem for two-dimensional curves).
convert everything to isPOD possible
  - ensure invocations to pass by reference use reference... but i think it should be fine.

- 3d Joints

gizmos for primitives

tab to re-enter last command of object

BUG:

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- figure 8 intersection hangs

Viewport week:
- keybindings to create/remove viewports

Cleanup week:
- add dispose methods anywhere there is signal.add or .addEventListener
- audit geometry disposable
