# PRE ALPHA:

stress test undo & redo
some bugs with move screenspace sometimes, it flickers?

add dialogs for everything

windows build

switching commands in multi-step commands has problems

- try switching commands while doing 3 point box

## POST ALPHA
should project onto construction plane in ortho view
min and max in number srubber should be respected

performance audit hit testing and snaps
refactor factory to take editorlike?
  -         factory.curves = this.editor.curves; // FIXME need to DI this in constructor of all factories

change selection mode 123 keys
fix box select

- audit depth pass

drag drop points?
    draw curve around solid


memoize mesh generation of faces in mesh creator (for the duration of a command).
memoize and discretize calculations like fillet

toggle kinds of snaps with keybindings?

need to convert offset curve to curve on surface
extrude to target

in moi, once you create a cylinder, you can shift once you lock onto Z axis; however, you can't then snap to match height. what do we want to do?
  - shift should turn current axis snap into constraint?

masking? like in zbrush; imagine a box atop a cylinder. I want to mask the box so I can clip curve just that.

select edge and face add rotate face gizmo

moving needs to have snapping
drag and drop points    

fillet face
extrude face

BUG/CRASH:
# 3
1. crashes-at-fillet-100.c3d
2. Fillet search 

# c++ changes:
rename Id() .id

audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:
    ::AddRefItems( curveArray );
    ::ReleaseItems( curveArray );
    and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether
    - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD
Get planar curve and placement if the space curve is planar (after the using call *******DeleteItem for two-dimensional curves).
convert everything to isPOD possible
  - ensure invocations to pass by reference use reference... but i think it should be fine.

- 3d Joints

gizmos for primitives

tab to re-enter last command of object

BUG:

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- figure 8 intersection hangs

--

Viewport week:
- keybindings to create/remove viewports

Cleanup week:
- add dispose methods anywhere there is signal.add or .addEventListener
- audit geometry disposable
