THIS WEEK:

hitting ok on the dialog is a normal event, no exceptions


transaction history


- delete creator
- mute creator, etc.
- handle rebuild errors


BUG:

both point picker and abstract gizmo take callbacks that should be async, because they call update which is potentially async
cylinder not working in many cases

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- lots of push pull grow/shrink crashes
- figure 8 intersection hangs


FUTURE:

dialog box for settings
modifiers

test case for contour curve failing to extrude;
fillet curve thingy

right click repeat

box selection

bug: outlines broken by grid

audit all doCommit to ensure visibility is set to true on failure;
  - perhaps the catch on Editor should call cancel

go through all factories and see if you can return more specific types from doCommit, like:
    -  Promise<visual.SpaceInstance<visual.Curve3D>> 

audit VisualModel to see if we can simplify the recursive raycasting. It was originally introduced for LODs, but maybe it can be done with deep raycasting and hit filtering.
