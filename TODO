need explode/separate command
stick to surface max / draw on surface
redo and more solid creators
redo Dialogs and show errors

rx90

delete Transactions.ts;

masking? like in zbrush; imagine a box atop a cylinder. I want to max the box so I can clip curve just that.

interleaving with updating/commit on factory. use q?
refactor factory to take editorlike?
  -         factory.curves = this.editor.curves; // FIXME need to DI this in constructor of all factories



moving needs to have snapping
redo fillet gizmos
drag and drop points

fillet face

right click repeat

change selection mode 123 keys

BUG/CRASH:
# 1
1. add regular polygon
2. extrude
3. fillet variable top face
4. push/pull face down
# 2
1. Add cylinder
2. Fillet top
3. Squeeze side to smallest possible

# transaction history
- delete creator
- select topo items
- mute creator, etc.
- handle rebuild errors
- there is a bug where fillet seems to highlight everything

# move keybindings outside of loop keybindings
- onPointerDown and on command (registry.addOne), store the viewport the pointer is over
- keep lastPointerEvent as a global on editor
- dispatch keyboard events to the target of lastPointerEvent

# c++ changes:
rename Id() .id

audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:
    ::AddRefItems( curveArray );
    ::ReleaseItems( curveArray );
    and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether
    - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD
Get planar curve and placement if the space curve is planar (after the using call *******DeleteItem for two-dimensional curves).

- 3d Joints


gizmos for primitives

tab to re-enter last command of object

auto save last object, auto lastGood

BUG:

BUGS for c3d
- crashes when extruding composite curve
- lots of push pull grow/shrink crashes
- figure 8 intersection hangs


FUTURE:

dialog box for settings

bug: outlines broken by grid

Viewport week:
- keybindings to create/remove viewports
- change view with keybinding

Cleanup week:
- add dispose methods anywhere there is signal.add or .addEventListener
- audit geometry disposable

Snap week:
- Prettier snap display
- More snaps
- alt/whatever to disable snaps
