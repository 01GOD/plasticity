Suppose an edge is selected and a fillet command is on the stack;

ViewportSelector
    onPointerHover(event: PointerEvent): void {
        const intersects = this.getIntersects(point, [...this.editor.db.drawModel]);
        this.editor.signals.hovered.dispatch(intersects);
    }

This captures a reference to the current object at t1;
It dispatches;
Dispatch cancels the fillet command;
  - this restores to a copy of state before fillet was started. View objects are cloned here though
It initiates the ChangeSelection command, but with a reference to object that is no longer pointer eq
