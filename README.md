#### About

Plasticity is a 3d modelling software for creating dimensionally accurate solid models. Modelling in Plasticity is quick due to the unique menu system, shortcuts and thoughtful feature procedures.

Plasticity is a unique application developed from the ground up with TypeScript featuring a newly developed 3D Kernel that can resolve features quickly.

#### Development

Plasticity is currently in the early stages of development with many more features to add and bugs to resolve. The project is currently in need of Beta Testers who can find and report bugs.
