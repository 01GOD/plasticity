# Plasticity

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Backlog

- [ ] If there is a solid and two curves. Select solid and SHIFT-H. Get an error like: "touched is not iterable" #bug  
- [ ] Redo titlebar to save space  
- [ ] crash https://discord.com/channels/893157887847845908/894216409188565012/896502833057243196  
- [ ] performance audit hit testing and snaps - use gpu picking #performance  
- [ ] memoize and discretize calculations like fillet #performance  
- [ ] memoize mesh generation of faces in mesh creator (for the duration of a command). #performance  
- [ ] in moi, once you create a cylinder, you can shift once you lock onto Z axis; however, you can't then snap to match height. what do we want to do?  
- [ ] showPhantoms() in ModifyContourPointFactory needs implementation  
- [ ] Nearpointprojection needs to be errorbool  
- [ ] Trim command should allow splitting segments  
- [ ] Trim command should allow points  
- [ ] Trim should allow box selecting  
- [ ] Move/Translate allows face selection #bug  
- [ ] making circle on corner box top or side face (needs to stick)  
- [ ] Box select during active command allows selecting faces that will be deleted #bug  
- [ ] PointPicker: Restrictions are ignored with choice -  
- [ ] PointPicker: Restrictions should allow points to be projected even if they don't strictly match the restriction  
- [ ] currently FINISH is always available, even at step 1 of 3 points box. #bug - registry.add(command:finish) should maybe not happen in command executor but in await this.finished  
- [ ] ctrl while point picking not working - https://discord.com/channels/893157887847845908/893157887847845913/896493308992421909  
- #bug  
- [ ] rename Id() .id  
- [ ] audit array conversion is reserving and freeing elements:  
- ::AddRefItems( curveArray );  
- ::ReleaseItems( curveArray );  
- and especially check if instantiated RPArray/etc. is freed altogether - convert MbCartPoint3D and Vector to isPOD  
- [ ] fillet face  

### Todo

- [ ] Refactor curve extension code  
- [ ] Curve generated by offset curve & flatten can't be edited  
- [ ] line2 raycasting bad in ortho camera  
- [ ] camera near plane sucks with ortho now  
- [ ] Viewport: save state  
- [ ] more robust mirror and consolidated with symmetry  
- [ ] Some gizmos should abort on interrupt (move xyz) and others should confirm (extrude)  
- [ ] 2D dashed line helper position off when inspector open  
- [ ] Audit re-used icons  

### In Progress


### Done âœ“

- [x] Curve generated by offset curve can't be edited
